# Twifire

A mod for **Star Wars: Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast** multiplayer servers.

### What It Was

Twifire was a mod that added a few key things:
- Admin stuff, of course. Any good JK2 server mod needs an admin system. Twifire's is based on dynamic account registration. There's readmes within release folder that explain how to set this up.
- A whole lot of admin features. Who needs that generic old "/amslap" and "/ampunish" when you can also use "/amabuse" and "/amabuse" and "/amfakelag" and whatever other nonsense!
- Mapmodding! In the era before Garry's Mod existed, this was pretty cool! You could spawn models and particle effects and custom interactables and stuff like that! All from within the game itself through simple commands! Incredible!
- Bug fixes. There are a few common bugs that can be fixed by VM mods, so Twifire fixed 'em.
- All the crowd favorites: emotes (like `/amsit`), jetpacks (refer to `/amhelp jetpack`), etc.
- A credits system, for some reason! I don't know why this was added and nobody ever used it seriously, but it was neat, so there's that!
- NPCs. Not bots, NPCs. Like, the singleplayer NPCs. Yeah!
- Vehicles! You can fly a TIE fighter or drive an ATST! Or turn yourself into a mouse droid if you want!
- Instagib! There's a command for it and even a vote call for it (specialgametype)!
- Weaponmodding! You can have guns that shoot faster/slower... and you can make it so lasers bounce on impact, or whatever nonsense like that (protip: repeater alt fire, with a high bounce count and super rapid fire, makes a beautiful energy worm)!
- Cool new custom entities! Like infinite automagic autoturrets! And 3D gravity sources! Yes, you can literally spawn planets and orbit them! In JK2! For some reason! IDK, it was fun!
- A minecraft tool! For... some reason! I never finished it, but there was the option to just start spawning minecraft blocks in with every click (requires AoF Content Pack on clients).
- User-friendly teleports! `/amrget` for example to *request* a 'get' teleport (and they must then `/amaccept` to be teleported).
- Chat teleports! Cause you gotta be able to chat `!temple` to get to the temple.
- A notes system! Users could read notes that could then be read by stepping on them. This was used for "The People's Map" (a project where players were allowed to leave notes with ideas for what to add into the map, which would then be built into the next update of the map).
- A chat channels system! Now you can speak with your friends... and *only* your friends! Screw everybody else!
- A mail system! Send a message to somebody for when they next log in!
- AFK tracking! That's helpful sometimes!

### History

This mod was developed somewhere in the late 2000's/early 2010's range.

This was originally meant as a mod for `[HACKS]` clan (led by me, mcmonkey, at the time) to use on our JK2 server.
Later, it was also used by `/AoF/` (which I did not lead but was a member of).

For the majority of its history, Twifire was a private and exclusive mod that only servers I hosted myself were able to run.
As development was winding down, alongside my personal interest in the game, I eventually released the mod to the general public.
This has been passingly used by a few small other servers, but to my knowledge never any noteworthy or active servers outside of the ones I hosted myself. (Note that the JK2 community was very small / dying off by the time Twifire was ever made public... for that matter, the community was well past its prime by the time Twifire even *started*).

Development ceased around 2013.
Not long after being stopped, source files were published to GitHub for general public usage/reference.

A small number of additional fixes have been made years later for the sole purpose of being usable in "for the nostalgia" temporary JK2 server hosting with my group.

### Current Status

This is a dead project, only minimally touched since 2013. If you want to use it in any serious capacity, feel free, but don't expect much support from me. Everything should still work fine, especially if paired with JK2:SE.
